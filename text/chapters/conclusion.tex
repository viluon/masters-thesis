We have designed a complex and incremental query-based language server
architecture for the \pfs language, including the lexing, preprocessing, and
incremental parsing steps. We have implemented a proof-of-concept language
server based on this architecture in Rust and integrated it with Visual Studio
Code using the \acrlong{lsp}. The language server provides lexer and parser
-based autocompletion, diagnostics for lexer, preprocessor, and parser errors,
as well as go-to definition functionality for a subset of the \pfs language.
