\begin{summarypage}
\section*{Introduction}

We open with an overview of the networking setting that led to the development
of the P4 language. After a brief survey of existing tooling, we decide to
implement our own.

\section*{The P4 Language}

Next, we delve into the details of P4 to better understand the commonalities and
differences between it and conventional programming languages.

\section*{Language Server Architecture}

We explore the language server protocol and existing LSP-compliant tools. We
also survey architectural themes in conventional compilers and pluck a few ripe
ideas for our own use later.

\section*{Design}

In this chapter, we detail the design of our language server. We go over the key
abstractions and algorithms, motivating our design decisions along the way.

\section*{Results}

The final chapter closes with lessons learned, our implementation's strengths,
and areas where it falls short. We conclude with a discussion of future work.
