\ctufitabstractCZE{Jazyk P4 je používán pro konfiguraci programovatelných
síťových procesorů. Navzdory své popularitě v odvětví Software Defined
Networking ale zaostává co se podpory programátora týče. V této práci navrhujeme
a implementujeme language server pro jazyk P4, který poskytuje podporu pro
lexikální analýzu, preprocessing a syntaktickou analýzu. Na těchto základech
stavíme automatické doplňování, reporting chyb a navigaci ve zdrojovém kódu.
Language server je implementován v jazyce Rust a integrován do vývojového
prostředí Visual Studio Code.}

\ctufitabstractENG{The P4 language is used for configuring programmable network
processors. Despite its popularity in the Software Defined Networking field, it
suffers from a lack of modern developer tooling. In this thesis, we design and
implement a language server for the P4 language, which provides support for
lexical analysis, preprocessing, and parsing. On these foundations, we build
support for autocompletion, error reporting, and navigation in the source code.
The language server is implemented in the Rust language and integrated into the
Visual Studio Code development environment.}

\begin{summarypage}
\section*{Introduction}

We open with an overview of the networking setting that led to the development
of the P4 language. After a brief survey of existing tooling, we decide to
implement our own.

\section*{The P4 Language}

Next, we delve into the details of P4 to better understand the commonalities and
differences between it and conventional programming languages.

\section*{Language Server Architecture}

We explore the language server protocol and existing LSP-compliant tools. We
also survey architectural themes in conventional compilers and pluck a few ripe
ideas for our own use later.

\section*{Design}

In this chapter, we detail the design of our language server. We go over the key
abstractions and algorithms, motivating our design decisions along the way.

\section*{Results}

The final chapter closes with lessons learned, our implementation's strengths,
and areas where it falls short. We conclude with a discussion of future work.
